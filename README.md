Accurate detection of canine cardiomegaly is crucial for diagnosing and treating cardiac conditions in dogs. The Vertebral Heart Score (VHS) is a widely recognized method for evaluating heart size on thoracic radiographs. This research details the development and implementation of an advanced deep learning method using the EfficientNetB7 model to automate VHS calculation. Our approach precisely identifies six key anatomical points on canine chest X-rays, achieving an accuracy of 79.50\%. This method significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of canine cardiomegaly detection, addressing challenges such as varying image quality and inter-patient variability. The use of EfficientNetB7 allows for a balance between computational efficiency and high performance. Our results demonstrate the potential of this model to enhance veterinary diagnostics by providing a more reliable and efficient tool for assessing heart size in dogs. This contributes to timely and accurate diagnoses, ultimately improving treatment outcomes for canine cardiac conditions.
