Accurate detection of canine cardiomegaly is crucial for
diagnosing and treating cardiac conditions in dogs. The
Vertebral Heart Score (VHS) is a widely recognized method
for evaluating heart size on thoracic radiographs. This re-
search details the development and implementation of an
advanced deep learning method using the EfficientNetB7
model to automate VHS calculation. Our approach pre-
cisely identifies six key anatomical points on canine chest X-
rays, achieving an accuracy of 79.50%. This method signif-
icantly improves the accuracy and reliability of canine car-
diomegaly detection, addressing challenges such as varying
image quality and inter-patient variability. The use of Effi-
cientNetB7 allows for a balance between computational ef-
ficiency and high performance. Our results demonstrate the
potential of this model to enhance veterinary diagnostics
by providing a more reliable and efficient tool for assessing
heart size in dogs. This contributes to timely and accurate
diagnoses, ultimately improving treatment outcomes for ca-
nine cardiac conditions.
